 * Writes a fancy progressbar with minimal input

 * from that. This is intended to be called in a loop / recursion / MPI thread
 * / pthread / etc. It should be called each time one of the nTotal elements is
 * done processing.
 * Can be fine-tuned for different length of the progressbar through a template
 *
 * @param nTotal the total number of elements to process. If multiple values
 *               are supplied in different calls, the function will try to use
 *               the highest of those values.
 * @param current (optional) the element you are currently at. This can be used
 *               to overwrite the default behaviour (which is to assume that an
 *               element was successfully processed each time this function is
 *               called)
 * @param length (template, optional) used to change the length of the printed
