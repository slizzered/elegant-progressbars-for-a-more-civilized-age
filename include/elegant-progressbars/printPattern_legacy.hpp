   * Writes progress as an ascii-art progressbar

   * progressbar should be filled. There may be supplied an additional pattern,
   * which will be moving as time passes. The pattern defaults to a sine-wave
   * like pattern. If no such movement and fancyness is desired, a single element
   * may be used as a pattern (e.g. "#").
   *
   * @param tic continuously increasing value related to the real outside time
   * @param percentage the progress as a fraction of 1
   * @param pattern (optional) the pattern of the wave (defaults to a wave)
   * @param length (template, optional) parameter to change the length of the
   *               finished pattern
